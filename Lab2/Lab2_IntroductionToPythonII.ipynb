    "Words and sentences are fundamental to how we communicate, so it follows that we'd want our computers to be able to work with words and sentences as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the way we store something like a word, a sentence, or even a whole paragraph is as a string. A string is a sequence of characters. It can be any length and can contain any letters, numbers, symbols, and spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn more about strings and how they are treated in Python. You will learn how to slice strings, select specific characters from strings, search strings for characters, iterate through strings, and use strings in conditional statements.\n",

    "Whoops, is that the first letter you expected? Notice that the letter at index 1 of \"blueberry\" isn't b, it's l. This is because the indices of a string start at 0. b is located at the zero index and we could select it using:\n",

    "## Cut Me a Slice of String\n",

    "string_name[first_index:last_index]\n",
    "```\n",

    ">>> favorite_fruit\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's say we wanted a new string that contains the letters eberr. We could slice favorite_fruit as follows:\n",

    "'eberr'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the character at the first index, e, is INCLUDED, but the character at the last index, y, is EXCLUDED. If you look for the indices 3 and 8 in the diagram, you can see how the y is outside that range.\n",
