If you were counting the number of people in a room, the number of jellybeans in a jar, or the number of keys on a keyboard you would likely use an integer.  \n",
    "A **floating-point number**, or a ```float```, is a decimal number. It can be used to represent fractional quantities as well as precise measurements. If you were measuring the length of your bedroom wall, calculating the average test score of a seventh-grade class, or storing a baseball player's batting average for the 1998 season you would likely use a ```float```.\n",
